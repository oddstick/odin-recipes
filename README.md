The purpose of the Odin Recipes project is to put current, basic knowledge of HTML to the test. 
While I could add some CSS styling, I am choosing to leave this site in its bare-bones state for now. 
As I write this, I have substituted Lorem Ipsum text for the recipes' actual ingredients and cooking steps lists.
This is because I forgot to bring my Indian cook book with me, which contains this information. 
While it is not necessary to proving my beginner HTML skills, having the real recipe and ingredients information
would look much better than lorem ipsum. I will likely add this in the future (and remove the related notes here after the fact).
